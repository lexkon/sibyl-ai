- For each transcript, analyze carefully to extract three clearly separated focal points, perspectives, or tonal angles.
- Use a different syntactic structure for each title (such as statement, question, metaphor, or wordplay), and ensure titles are attention-grabbing but not overly clickbait-y or generic sounding.
- For each description (1-2 sentences, no more than 150 words), summarize why the episode is interesting from its unique angle. Descriptions must not reuse words, phrases, or sentence structuresâ€”each should feel like it was written by a different person with a different focus.
- Your output must maximize the uniqueness and creativity of each pair.
- Never repeat any significant wording or structure between your suggestions.
